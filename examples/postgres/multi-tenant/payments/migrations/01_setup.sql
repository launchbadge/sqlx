-- We try to ensure every table has `created_at` and `updated_at` columns, which can help immensely with debugging
-- and auditing.
--
-- While `created_at` can just be `default now()`, setting `updated_at` on update requires a trigger which
-- is a lot of boilerplate. These two functions save us from writing that every time as instead we can just do
--
-- select payments.trigger_updated_at('<table name>');
--
-- after a `CREATE TABLE`.
