/// Many of these options, if changed after migrations are set up,

    ///
    /// May be schema-qualified and/or contain quotes. Defaults to `_sqlx_migrations`.
    ///
    /// Potentially useful for multi-tenant databases.
    ///
    /// ### Warning: Potential Data Loss or Corruption!
    /// Changing this option for a production database will likely result in data loss or corruption
    /// as the migration machinery will no longer be aware of what migrations have been applied
    /// and will attempt to re-run them.
    ///
    /// You should create the new table as a copy of the existing migrations table (with contents!),
    /// and be sure all instances of your application have been migrated to the new
    /// table before deleting the old one.
    ///
    /// ### Example
    /// `sqlx.toml`:
    /// ```toml
    /// [migrate]
    /// # Put `_sqlx_migrations` in schema `foo`
    /// table-name = "foo._sqlx_migrations"
    /// ```

    /// Specify characters that should be ignored when hashing migrations.
    ///
    /// Any characters contained in the given array will be dropped when a migration is hashed.
    ///
    /// ### Warning: May Change Hashes for Existing Migrations
    /// Changing the characters considered in hashing migrations will likely
    /// change the output of the hash.
    ///
    /// This may require manual rectification for deployed databases.
    ///
    /// ### Example: Ignore Carriage Return (`<CR>` | `\r`)
    /// Line ending differences between platforms can result in migrations having non-repeatable
    /// hashes. The most common culprit is the carriage return (`<CR>` | `\r`), which Windows
    /// uses in its line endings alongside line feed (`<LF>` | `\n`), often written `CRLF` or `\r\n`,
    /// whereas Linux and macOS use only line feeds.
    ///
    /// `sqlx.toml`:
    /// ```toml
    /// [migrate]
    /// ignored-chars = ["\r"]
    /// ```
    ///
    /// For projects using Git, this can also be addressed using [`.gitattributes`]:
    ///
    /// ```text
    /// # Force newlines in migrations to be line feeds on all platforms
    /// migrations/*.sql text eol=lf
    /// ```
    ///
    /// This may require resetting or re-checking out the migrations files to take effect.
    ///
    /// [`.gitattributes`]: https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes
    ///
    /// ### Example: Ignore all Whitespace Characters
    /// To make your migrations amenable to reformatting, you may wish to tell SQLx to ignore
    /// _all_ whitespace characters in migrations.
    ///
    /// ##### Warning: Beware Syntatically Significant Whitespace!
    /// If your migrations use string literals or quoted identifiers which contain whitespace,
    /// this configuration will cause the migration machinery to ignore some changes to these.
    /// This may result in a mismatch between the development and production versions of
    /// your database.
    ///
    /// `sqlx.toml`:
    /// ```toml
    /// [migrate]
    /// # Ignore common whitespace characters when hashing
    /// ignored-chars = [" ", "\t", "\r", "\n"]  # Space, tab, CR, LF
    /// ```
