/// A SQL string that is safe to execute on a database connection.
///
/// A "safe" SQL string is one that is unlikely to contain a [SQL injection vulnerability][injection].
///
/// In practice, this means a string type that is unlikely to contain dynamic data or user input.
///
/// `&'static str` is the only string type that satisfies the requirements of this trait
/// (ignoring [`String::leak()`] which has niche use-cases) and so is the only string type that
/// natively implements this trait by default.
///
/// For other string types, use [`AssertSqlSafe`] to assert this property.
/// This is the only intended way to pass an owned `String` to [`query()`] and its related functions
/// as well as [`raw_sql()`].
///
/// The maintainers of SQLx take no responsibility for any data leaks or loss resulting from misuse
/// of this API.
///
/// ### Motivation
/// This is designed to act as a speed bump against naively using `format!()` to add dynamic data
/// or user input to a query, which is a classic vector for SQL injection as SQLx does not
/// provide any sort of escaping or sanitization (which would have to be specially implemented
/// for each database flavor/locale).
///
/// The recommended way to incorporate dynamic data or user input in a query is to use
/// bind parameters, which requires the query to execute as a prepared statement.
/// See [`query()`] for details.
///
/// This trait and [`AssertSqlSafe`] are intentionally analogous to
/// [`std::panic::UnwindSafe`] and [`std::panic::AssertUnwindSafe`], respectively.
///

/// [SQL injection vulnerability][injection]. It means that, if the string was constructed
/// dynamically, and/or from user input, you have taken care to sanitize the input yourself.
/// SQLx does not provide any sort of sanitization; the design of SQLx prefers the use
/// of prepared statements for dynamic input.
///
/// The maintainers of SQLx take no responsibility for any data leaks or loss resulting from misuse
/// of this API. **Use at your own risk.**
