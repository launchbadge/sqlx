/// ### Dynamic Input: Use Query Parameters (Prevents SQL Injection)
/// At some point, you'll likely want to include some form of dynamic input in your query, possibly from the user.

/// ```rust,no_run
/// # async fn example() -> sqlx::Result<()> {
/// # let mut conn: sqlx::PgConnection = unimplemented!();
/// // Imagine this is input from the user, e.g. a search form on a website.
/// let user_input = "possibly untrustworthy input!";
///
/// // DO NOT DO THIS unless you're ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN it's what you need!
/// let query = format!("SELECT * FROM articles WHERE content LIKE '%{user_input}%'");
/// // where `conn` is `PgConnection` or `MySqlConnection`
/// // or some other type that implements `Executor`.
/// let results = sqlx::query(&query).fetch_all(&mut conn).await?;
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// The example above showcases a **SQL injection vulnerability**, because it's trivial for a malicious user to craft
/// an input that can "break out" of the string literal.
///
/// For example, if they send the input `foo'; DELETE FROM articles; --`
/// then your application would send the following to the database server (line breaks added for clarity):
///
/// ```sql
/// SELECT * FROM articles WHERE content LIKE '%foo';
/// DELETE FROM articles;
/// --%'
/// ```
///
/// In this case, because this interface *always* uses prepared statements, you would likely be fine because prepared
/// statements _generally_ (see above) are only allowed to contain a single query. This would simply return an error.
///
/// However, it would also break on legitimate user input.
/// What if someone wanted to search for the string `Alice's Apples`? It would also return an error because
/// the database would receive a query with a broken string literal (line breaks added for clarity):
///
/// ```sql
/// SELECT * FROM articles WHERE content LIKE '%Alice'
/// s Apples%'
/// ```
///
/// Of course, it's possible to make this syntactically valid by escaping the apostrophe, but there's a better way.
///
/// ##### You should always prefer query parameters for dynamic input.
///
/// When using query parameters, you add placeholders to your query where a value
/// should be substituted at execution time, then call [`.bind()`][Query::bind] with that value.
///
/// The syntax for placeholders is unfortunately not standardized and depends on the database:
///
/// * Postgres and SQLite: use `$1`, `$2`, `$3`, etc.
///     * The number is the Nth bound value, starting from one.
///     * The same placeholder can be used arbitrarily many times to refer to the same bound value.
///     * SQLite technically supports MySQL's syntax as well as others, but we recommend using this syntax
///       as SQLx's SQLite driver is written with it in mind.
/// * MySQL and MariaDB: use `?`.
///     * Placeholders are purely positional, similar to `println!("{}, {}", foo, bar)`.
///     * The order of bindings must match the order of placeholders in the query.
///     * To use a value in multiple places, you must bind it multiple times.
///
/// In both cases, the placeholder syntax acts as a variable expression representing the bound value:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # async fn example2() -> sqlx::Result<()> {
/// # let mut conn: sqlx::PgConnection = unimplemented!();
/// let user_input = "Alice's Apples";
///
/// // Postgres and SQLite
/// let results = sqlx::query(
///     // Notice how we only have to bind the argument once and we can use it multiple times:
///     "SELECT * FROM articles
///      WHERE title LIKE '%' || $1 || '%'
///      OR content LIKE '%' || $1 || '%'"
/// )
///     .bind(user_input)
///     .fetch_all(&mut conn)
///     .await?;
///
/// // MySQL and MariaDB
/// let results = sqlx::query(
///     "SELECT * FROM articles
///      WHERE title LIKE CONCAT('%', ?, '%')
///      OR content LIKE CONCAT('%', ?, '%')"
/// )
///     // If we want to reference the same value multiple times, we have to bind it multiple times:
///     .bind(user_input)
///     .bind(user_input)
///     .fetch_all(&mut conn)
///     .await?;
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
/// ##### The value bound to a query parameter is entirely separate from the query and does not affect its syntax.
/// Thus, SQL injection is impossible (barring shenanigans like calling a SQL function that lets you execute a string
/// as a statement) and *all* strings are valid.
///
/// This also means you cannot use query parameters to add conditional SQL fragments.
///
/// **SQLx does not substitute placeholders on the client side**. It is done by the database server itself.
///
/// ##### SQLx supports many different types for parameter binding, not just strings.
/// Any type that implements [`Encode<DB>`][Encode] and [`Type<DB>`] can be bound as a parameter.
///
/// See [the `types` module][crate::types] (links to `sqlx_core::types` but you should use `sqlx::types`) for details.
///
/// As an additional benefit, query parameters are usually sent in a compact binary encoding instead of a human-readable
/// text encoding, which saves bandwidth.
