// AUTHOR'S NOTE: I was just going to call this API `sql()` and `Sql`, respectively,
// but realized that would be extremely annoying to deal with as a SQLite user
// because IDE smart completion would always recommend the `Sql` type first.
//
// It doesn't really need a super convenient name anyway as it's not meant to be used very often.

/// One or more raw SQL statements, separated by semicolons (`;`).
///
/// See [`raw_sql()`] for details.
pub struct RawSql<'q>(&'q str);

/// Execute one or more statements as raw SQL, separated by semicolons (`;`).
///
/// This interface can be used to execute both DML
/// (Data Manipulation Language: `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` and variants)
/// as well as DDL (Data Definition Language: `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, etc).
///
/// This will not create or cache any prepared statements.
///
/// ### Note: singular DML queries, prefer `query()`
/// This API does not use prepared statements, so usage of it is missing out on their benefits.
///
/// Prefer [`query()`][crate::query::query] instead if executing a single query.
///
/// It's also possible to combine multiple DML queries into one for use with `query()`:
///
/// ##### Common Table Expressions (CTEs: i.e The `WITH` Clause)
/// Common Table Expressions effectively allow you to define aliases for queries
/// that can be referenced like temporary tables:
///
/// ```sql
/// WITH inserted_foos AS (
///     -- Note that only Postgres allows data-modifying statements in CTEs
///     INSERT INTO foo (bar_id) VALUES ($1)
///     RETURNING foo_id, bar_id
/// )
/// SELECT foo_id, bar_id, bar
/// FROM inserted_foos
/// INNER JOIN bar USING (bar_id)
/// ```
///
/// It's important to note that data modifying statements (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) may
/// behave differently than expected. In Postgres, all data-modifying subqueries in a `WITH`
/// clause execute with the same view of the data; they *cannot* see each other's modifications.
///
/// MySQL, MariaDB and SQLite appear to *only* allow `SELECT` statements in CTEs.
///
/// See the appropriate entry in your database's manual for details:
/// * [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/with.html)
///     * [MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/with/)
/// * [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/queries-with.html)
/// * [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_with.html)
///
/// ##### `UNION`/`INTERSECT`/`EXCEPT`
/// You can also use various set-theory operations on queries,
/// including `UNION ALL` which simply concatenates their results.
///
/// See the appropriate entry in your database's manual for details:
/// * [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/set-operations.html)
///    * [MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/joins-subqueries/)
/// * [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/queries-union.html)
/// * [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_select.html#compound_select_statements)
///
/// ### Note: query parameters are not supported.
/// Query parameters require the use of prepared statements which this API does support.
///
/// If you require dynamic input data in your SQL, you can use `format!()` but **be very careful
/// doing this with user input**. SQLx does **not** provide escaping or sanitization for inserting
/// dynamic input into queries this way.
///
/// See [`query()`][crate::query::query] for details.
///
/// ### Note: multiple statements and autocommit.
/// By default, when you use this API to execute a SQL string containing multiple statements
/// separated by semicolons (`;`), the database server will treat those statements as all executing
/// within the same transaction block, i.e. wrapped in `BEGIN` and `COMMIT`:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # async fn example() -> sqlx::Result<()> {
/// let mut conn: sqlx::PgConnection = todo!("e.g. PgConnection::connect(<DATABASE URL>)");
///
/// sqlx::raw_sql(
///     // Imagine we're moving data from one table to another:
///     // Implicit `BEGIN;`
///     "UPDATE foo SET bar = foobar.bar FROM foobar WHERE foobar.foo_id = foo.id;\
///      DELETE FROM foobar;"
///     // Implicit `COMMIT;`
/// )
///    .execute(&mut conn)
///    .await?;
///
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// If one statement triggers an error, the whole script aborts and rolls back.
/// You can include explicit `BEGIN` and `COMMIT` statements in the SQL string
/// to designate units that can be committed or rolled back piecemeal.
///
/// This also allows for a rudimentary form of pipelining as the whole SQL string is sent in one go.
///
/// ##### MySQL and MariaDB: DDL implicitly commits!
/// MySQL and MariaDB do not support DDL in transactions. Instead, any active transaction is
/// immediately and implicitly committed by the database server when executing a DDL statement.
/// Beware of this behavior.
///
/// See [MySQL manual, section 13.3.3: Statements That Cause an Implicit Commit](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/implicit-commit.html) for details.
/// See also: [MariaDB manual: SQL statements That Cause an Implicit Commit](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/sql-statements-that-cause-an-implicit-commit/).
