/// A mutex-like type utilizing [Postgres advisory locks].
///
/// Advisory locks are a mechanism provided by Postgres to have mutually exclusive or shared
/// locks tracked in the database with application-defined semantics, as opposed to the standard
/// row-level or table-level locks which may not fit all use-cases.
///
/// This API provides a convenient wrapper for generating and storing the integer keys that
/// advisory locks use, as well as RAII guards for releasing advisory locks when they fall out
/// of scope.
///
/// This API only handles session-scoped advisory locks (explicitly locked and unlocked, or
/// automatically released when a connection is closed).
///
/// It is also possible to use transaction-scoped locks but those can be used by beginning a
/// transaction and calling the appropriate lock functions (e.g. `SELECT pg_advisory_xact_lock()`)
/// manually, and cannot be explicitly released, but are automatically released when a transaction
/// ends (is committed or rolled back).
///
/// Session-level locks can be acquired either inside or outside a transaction and are not
/// tied to transaction semantics; a lock acquired inside a transaction is still held when that
/// transaction is committed or rolled back, until explicitly released or the connection is closed.
///
/// Locks can be acquired in either shared or exclusive modes, which can be thought of as read locks
/// and write locks, respectively. Multiple shared locks are allowed for the same key, but a single
/// exclusive lock prevents any other lock being taken for a given key until it is released.
